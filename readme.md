## Dino's Offline Adventure

### You heard it right a new Gameboy game in 2018!

**Dino's Offline Adventure** is a port of the modern classic built into Chrome the web browser.  

Built as our first Gameboy game and developed using the Gameboy Development Kit ([GBDK](http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/)) this simple game is even more of a challenge on the smaller Gameboy screen. Although you may learn a lot by reading the source code for this game it should be in no way considered a good practice example of writing 'c' or using GBDK this is our first project with both.

### How do I compile this myself?

First go to ([GBDK](http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/)) and follow the instructions there for installing it on your platform. Then open (in your favourite text edit, I recommend VisualStudio Code) and edit build.bat so that the path to GBDK 'c:\gbdk\bin\lcc' matches your setup. Once you have that done just run build.bat in your terminal/command prompt. If all works well the output of this will be dinosofflineadventure.gb being created in the project directory which you can then use in your emulator / flashcard of choice.
